## What is this about?

This spec aims to define an `aspect-ratio` property to provide a way CSS authors can inform the browser of a desired aspect ratio for an element unless a more specific `width` and `height` are defined.

## Who am I?

I'm an independent web developer, not affiliated with any major company. The research & development contained in this spec is my own.

## How you can help

At this stage the work on this spec is focused on specifying the behaviour described in this [Github thread]() as well as the plugin working at [staticresource.com/aspect-ratio.html](http://staticresource.com/aspect-ratio.html).

For now, the most productive way to provide input would be by contributing to the conversation in the [Gitter chat room for the EQCSS project](https://gitter.im/eqcss/eqcss).
